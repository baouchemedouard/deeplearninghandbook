### Notes about Assignments 

Mathematical assignments are written under Latex (and were developed under overleaf.com). We use the dlbook notation and files.

Programming assignments are python notebook files (and were developed under colab.research.google.com)

The file **Fish.csv** for **Assignment 1** is provided.

### dlbook_notation, quoting the deep learning book authors:  

> LaTeX files for the Deep Learning book notation
>
> These are the files we used to define the style of the Deep Learning
> textbook (www.deeplearningbook.org) as well as the .tex file for
> the notation page.
>
> We make them freely available for anyone to use.
>
> For more information, see notation_example.pdf.
