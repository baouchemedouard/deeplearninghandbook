### The Deep Learning _Handbook_ 

The [Deep Learning book](https://www.deeplearningbook.org/) by Goodfellow et al. is a rich and interesting book to introduce the booming topic of deep learning. However, many found the accompanying video lectures, slides and exercises not pedagogic enough for a fresh starter. 

I used this book for the class I taught in Spring 2019/2020 at the computer science department, American University of Beirut. 
I would like to share my experience by publishing the slides and some of the assignments on this page. The project may be developed further into a full handbook accompanying the very interesting text of Goodfellow et al. 
Currently, only part I and part II are covered.
